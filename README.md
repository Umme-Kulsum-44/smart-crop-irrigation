# Smart Crop Recommendation & Irrigation (Week 1)

This repository is for my Edunet Foundation 4-week internship project.

## Week 1 (30% Progress)
- ✅ Collected dataset: `data/raw/smart-crop-irrigation.csv`
- ✅ Performed EDA & preprocessing in `notebooks/1_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
- ✅ Saved `data/processed/preprocessed.csv` and `label_encoder.joblib`
- ✅ Added basic visualizations (class balance, feature histograms)

## Next (Week 2 – 60%)
- Train baseline models (RandomForest/XGBoost)
- Evaluate metrics & confusion matrix
- Start simple Streamlit prototype

## How to run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
